<p>     Hello! My Name is Krishiv Mahendru, I am currently in APCSA and welcome to my github pages. I created this page to go through and help get a better understanding of my coding journey. I wrote my first lines of actual code last year in python and before that I had experience in elementary/middle school scratch and code.org. Over the last year I was able to grow a lot in apcsp becuase I was able to learn more about good coding practices, and how you code properly in teams. My favorite lesson last year was about agile methodology because it really showed how a team can work through a sprint. This lesson was where I learned a lot by wasnt able to apply these practice for a while becuase some of my bad habits in CSP was not blogging when I ran into errors wich led to me getting the same errors after many weeks again. In addition to that many times in csp I sturggled to manage time and effectivley get quality work done until the last minuete which led to many parts of my tangibles to be lacking function and depth in my code. In addition something else  I want to work on this year is my ability to understand code better, this is becuase last year I felt when doing assignment I would just google answer and not be able to understand what I wrote becuase of lack of documentation and lack of effort to be better which is why this year  I was my code to be cleaner and explainable.  </p>
